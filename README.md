This project follows *```MVC architecture```* and is deployed on *Apache Tomcat*.

##  Features
- *Create*  : Add new students to the database  
- *Read*  : View a list of all students  
- *Update*  : Edit details of existing students  
- *Delete*  : Remove students from the database  

##  Tech Stack
- *Backend*: Java, Servlet API, JDBC  
- *Frontend*: JSP, JSTL, HTML, Bootstrap 5  
- *Database*: MySQL  
- *Server*: Apache Tomcat  
- *IDE*: Eclipse
